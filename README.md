# conquer-once

Synchronization primitives for lazy and one-time initialization using low-level
blocking mechanisms with clear distinction between blocking and non-blocking
methods and additional support for `#[no_std]` environments when using
spin-locks.

## Usage

To use this crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`

```
[dependencies]
conquer-once = "0.1.2"
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The minimum supported Rust version for this crate is 1.36.0.

## Cargo Features

By default, `conquer-once` enables the `std` feature.
With this feature enabled, the crate exports the `Lazy`, `Once` and `OnceCell`
types that use an OS and standard library reliant blocking mechanism.
Without this feature, the crate is `#[no_std]` environment compatible, but only
exports the types in the crate's `spin` sub-module, which use spin-locks.

The feature can be disabled by specifying the dependency as follows:

``` 
[dependencies.conquer-once]
version = "0.1.1"
use-default-features = false
```
